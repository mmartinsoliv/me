Many users adjust their browser's default font size for better readability. As developers, respecting these preferences is crucial for accessibility and user experience.

Here's a reliable method to detect the browser's default font size using CSS and JavaScript.

## The CSS Foundation

First, create an element with the `medium` keyword, which always corresponds to the browser's default font size:

```css
.measure-element {
  font-size: medium;
  position: absolute;
  visibility: hidden;
  white-space: nowrap;
}
```

The `medium` keyword is specialâ€”it's not affected by parent elements or CSS resets, making it the most reliable way to access the true browser default.

## Reading the Value with JavaScript

Once the element is styled, we can measure it programmatically:

```javascript
// Create and append the measuring element
const measureElement = document.createElement('div');
measureElement.className = 'measure-element';
measureElement.textContent = 'M'; // Use a character for measurement
document.body.appendChild(measureElement);

// Get the computed font size
const fontSize = parseInt(getComputedStyle(measureElement).fontSize, 10);

// Clean up
document.body.removeChild(measureElement);

console.log(`Default font size: ${fontSize}px`);
```

## Why This Matters

Different users have different needs:

- **Default (16px)**: Most users keep this setting
- **Large (20px)**: Users who prefer slightly larger text  
- **Very Large (24px)**: Users with vision difficulties or high-DPI displays

By detecting and respecting these preferences, your application becomes more accessible and user-friendly.

## Practical Applications

Use this technique to:

- Scale UI components proportionally to font size
- Adjust spacing and layout based on user preferences
- Ensure consistent relative sizing across different devices
- Build truly responsive designs that adapt to accessibility settings

This approach ensures your web application respects user preferences while maintaining visual harmony across different font size settings.
